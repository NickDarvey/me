## Pride in craftsmanship 
Pay close attention to detail because the love shines through.

## Products over projects
Start with a vision embraced by an enduring team because it will deliver more value, more quickly than arbitrary milestones.

## Win as one
Develop candid relationships with colleagues, clients, and partners because the best work comes with alignment.

## Guardianship not ownership
Far too little work considers longevity. (Why does 'legacy' has negative connotations in software?) Considering the product's well-being and acknowledging the transience of your involvement will build resilient value.
